At 23 years old, I proudly call Rio de Janeiro my home. I am pursuing my studies in Systems Analysis and Development while holding a bachelor's degree in Journalism. My passion for technology and communication drives me, and I am currently transitioning into the field of cybersecurity. I am passionate about solving complex problems and eager to contribute to the industry.

## Objective
I am actively pursuing the Google Cybersecurity Certificate and am enthusiastic about applying my learning to real-world scenarios. My ultimate goal is to become a part of a Security Operations Center (SOC) as a Tier 1 Analyst, where I can leverage my skills in cybersecurity to protect critical systems.
